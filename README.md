## FAQ

#### What is Nyxx, and why should I use it?

Nyxx is a multi-purpose Discord Bot that can do everything most bots can do, such as Moderation, Music, and more.

#### Can I self-host Nyxx?

Short answer: No.

Long Answer: Yes, you technically could, but I highly advise against that. You would most likely need to make **major** modifications to the code.
